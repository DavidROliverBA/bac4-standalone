# BAC4 Standalone: Interactive C4 Modelling for Solution Architects

*A browser-based, zero-install tool for creating and maintaining C4 architecture diagrams with visual drag-and-drop editing*

---

## The Challenge: Documentation That Stays Current

As solution architects, we face a constant dilemma: architecture documentation needs to be both comprehensive and maintainable. The C4 model, introduced by Simon Brown, has become the de facto standard for documenting software architecture through its clear hierarchical approach (Context, Container, Component, Code). However, existing tools present trade-offs:

- **PlantUML/C4-PlantUML**: Excellent for version control and code review, but requires learning DSL syntax and involves a render-preview cycle that slows iterative design
- **Draw.io/Lucidchart**: Visual and intuitive, but diagrams become disconnected from structured data, making them difficult to maintain or programmatically validate
- **Enterprise tools**: Feature-rich but require installation, licensing, training, and ongoing maintenance

What if we could combine the best of both worlds: the visual immediacy of drag-and-drop tools with the structured data approach of text-based formats?

## Introducing BAC4 Standalone

BAC4 Standalone is an interactive C4 modelling tool that runs entirely in your browser as a single HTML file. No server, no installation, no dependencies—just open it and start designing.

### What Makes It Different

**1. True Standalone Architecture**
- Single 450KB HTML file containing everything
- Works completely offline
- No cloud services, no data transmission
- Distribute via email, USB, or intranet

**2. Visual-First, Data-Aware Design**
- Drag-and-drop interface for rapid prototyping
- Structured data model underneath
- Export to 7 formats including PlantUML, Mermaid, and JSON
- Properties panel for detailed element metadata

**3. Zero Learning Curve**
- If you understand C4, you understand the tool
- Context-aware toolbar shows only relevant element types
- Auto-switching between abstraction levels
- Intelligent auto-layout algorithms

**4. Architecture-Focused Features**
- Level-aware element visibility (Context → Container → Component → Code)
- Relationship customization (arrow direction, line styles, protocols)
- Tags for categorization and filtering
- Auto-save with localStorage persistence

## How It Works: Technical Architecture

```

### State Management

We use Zustand for lightweight, predictable state management:

```javascript
// Separate arrays for each C4 element type
{
  systems: [],
  containers: [],
  components: [],
  people: [],
  externalSystems: [],
  relationships: [],
  currentLevel: 'context',
  selectedElement: null
}
```

Key decision: Individual array subscriptions prevent re-render cascades while maintaining reactivity.

### Level-Aware Filtering

The tool enforces C4 level semantics:

| Level | Visible Elements |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Context** | Systems, People, External Systems |
| **Container** | Systems, Containers, People, External Systems |
| **Component** | Containers, Components, People |
| **Code** | Components only |

When you add an element, the system automatically switches to an appropriate level for visibility. The toolbar dynamically shows only relevant element types for your current level.

### Export Pipeline

Each export format follows a consistent pipeline:

```
Model (Zustand) → Transform → Format → Download
```

**JSON Export**: Direct serialization of the model state—ideal for backup and import.

**PlantUML Export**: Transforms model into C4-PlantUML syntax:
```plantuml
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../C4_Container.puml

Person(user, "Customer", "A customer of the system")
System_Ext(email, "Email System", "Sends notifications")
Container(api, "API", "REST API", "Spring Boot")

Rel(user, api, "Uses", "HTTPS")
Rel(api, email, "Sends email via", "SMTP")
@enduml
```

**Mermaid Export**: Modern alternative with native GitHub/GitLab support:
```mermaid
C4Container
  title Container Diagram

  Person(user, "Customer", "A customer of the system")
  System_Ext(email, "Email System", "Sends notifications")
  Container(api, "API", "REST API", "Spring Boot")

  Rel(user, api, "Uses", "HTTPS")
  Rel(api, email, "Sends email via", "SMTP")
```

**Markdown Export**: Structured documentation with tables—perfect for Confluence, wikis, or README files.

**HTML Export**: Self-contained document with metadata, element tables, relationships, and embedded PlantUML code.

**PNG/SVG Export**: Visual snapshots using html-to-image library for presentations and documentation.

### Auto-Layout Algorithms

Four layout algorithms handle different scenarios:

1. **Hierarchical**: Layer-based layout respecting C4 hierarchy (Person → System → Container → Component)
2. **Grid**: Uniform spacing for simple, organized diagrams
3. **Circular**: Emphasizes connections and communication patterns
4. **Force-Directed**: Physics simulation minimizing overlap—best for organic, relationship-heavy diagrams

## Use Cases for Solution Architects

### 1. Workshop Facilitation

**Scenario**: Architecture design workshop with stakeholders who don't know PlantUML syntax.

**Approach**:
- Open BAC4 in presentation mode
- Drag elements as stakeholders describe the system
- Immediately visualize relationships
- Export to PlantUML/Mermaid for version control post-workshop

**Benefit**: Visual collaboration without syntax barriers, with structured output for documentation.

---

### 2. Rapid Prototyping

**Scenario**: Exploring multiple architectural options during solution design.

## Getting Started: A Practical Example

Let's model a simple e-commerce system:

### Step 1: Context Diagram

1. Open `bac4-standalone.html`
2. Level selector shows "Context"
3. Add elements:
   - Person: "Customer"
   - System: "E-Commerce Platform"
   - External System: "Payment Gateway"
   - External System: "Email Service"
4. Create relationships:
   - Customer → E-Commerce Platform: "Browses products, places orders"
   - E-Commerce Platform → Payment Gateway: "Processes payments via REST API"
   - E-Commerce Platform → Email Service: "Sends order confirmations via SMTP"

**Result**: High-level system context in under 2 minutes.

---

### Step 2: Container Diagram

1. Switch level to "Container"
2. Add containers:
   - Container: "Web Application" (React)
   - Container: "API Gateway" (Spring Boot)
   - Container: "Order Service" (Node.js)
   - Container: "PostgreSQL Database"
   - Container: "Redis Cache"
3. Create relationships:
   - Web App → API Gateway: "Makes API calls" (HTTPS)
   - API Gateway → Order Service: "Routes requests" (gRPC)
   - Order Service → PostgreSQL: "Reads/writes" (SQL)
   - Order Service → Redis: "Caches data" (Redis Protocol)

**Result**: Detailed container breakdown showing technology choices.

---

### Step 3: Export and Document

1. **Export JSON**: Backup of your work
2. **Export PlantUML**: For version control in repository
3. **Export Mermaid**: For GitHub README or wiki
4. **Export Markdown**: For Confluence documentation
5. **Export PNG**: For architecture presentation deck

**Result**: 5 deliverables from a single model in 30 seconds.

---

## Best Practices for Solution Architects

### 1. Start Broad, Refine Progressively

Begin with Context diagrams before diving into Containers. Validate high-level understanding with stakeholders before adding detail.

### 2. Use Tags for Governance

Tag elements with:
- **Status**: `legacy`, `new`, `deprecated`, `planned`
- **Domain**: `payment`, `inventory`, `fulfillment`
- **Criticality**: `critical`, `important`, `standard`

(Note: Tags are stored in metadata but not currently visualized—useful for exports and future filtering)

### 3. Leverage Multiple Export Formats

- **JSON**: Primary source of truth (commit to repository)
- **PlantUML/Mermaid**: For docs-as-code workflows
- **PNG**: For presentations and slide decks
- **Markdown**: For wikis and internal documentation

### 4. Combine with Text-Based Tools

BAC4 excels at visual design and rapid iteration. For:
- CI/CD integration
- Automated diagram generation
- Large-scale diagram management

...export to PlantUML and use text-based workflows.

### 5. Document Relationships Thoroughly

Don't just draw lines—add:
- **Description**: "Sends order events to" (not just "uses")
- **Technology**: "Kafka with Avro serialization"
- **Arrow Direction**: Shows data flow direction
- **Line Style**: Dashed for async, solid for sync

This metadata enriches exports and clarifies communication patterns.

### 6. Use Auto-Layout as a Starting Point

Start with Hierarchical layout, then manually adjust:
- Move critical elements to prominent positions
- Group related elements visually
- Adjust spacing for clarity

Manual refinement after auto-layout gives professional results quickly.

## Technical Considerations

### Security

- **No data transmission**: Everything runs client-side
- **No external dependencies**: All assets inlined
- **Safe distribution**: Single HTML file with no executable code beyond standard JavaScript

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile browsers: Limited (desktop-optimized interface)

### Performance

- Tested up to 50 elements without lag
- React Flow handles canvas rendering
- Auto-save throttled to prevent performance impact
- Layout algorithms optimized for typical C4 diagram sizes

### Data Persistence

- **localStorage**: Auto-saves every 30 seconds + on page close
- **Quota**: ~5MB typical limit (sufficient for hundreds of diagrams)
- **Backup**: Export JSON regularly to avoid localStorage quota issues

---

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Confluence Integration

1. Create diagrams in BAC4
2. Export as PNG for visual embedding
3. Export as Markdown for tabular documentation
4. Attach JSON file for future editing

### GitHub/GitLab Integration

1. Store JSON models in `docs/architecture/` directory
2. Export to Mermaid (`.mmd` files)
3. Embed Mermaid in README files (native rendering)
4. Add PNG exports to `docs/images/` for offline viewing

### ADR (Architecture Decision Records) Integration
